# Course Modules Directory Instructions for Training Team

## Purpose
This directory contains all course module files, including presentations, practical manuals, and supplementary materials essential for delivering the course content effectively.

## Suggested File Types
- Presentation slides (PowerPoint, Word Documents, PDF)
- Practical manuals (Markdown, PDF)
- Supplementary instructional materials </br>

**Important Note**: It is highly advised to convert PowerPoint and Word Documents into PDFs before uploading. 

## Best Practices for Naming Conventions
To ensure clarity and consistency, please follow these naming conventions for your files:
- Use descriptive names that reflect the content (e.g., `module_1_overview.pptx`, `module_2_practical_manual.md`).
- Use lowercase letters and separate words with underscores (_) for better readability.
- Include version numbers if necessary (e.g., `module_v1.0.pdf`).

## Steps to Add Files via GitHub Interface
1. **Navigate to the Repository:** Go to the GitHub repository for the course.
2. **Select the `course_modules` Directory:** Click on the `course_modules` folder to open it.
3. **Click on "Add file":** On the right-hand side, youâ€™ll see an option labelled **Add file**.
4. **Choose "Upload files":** From the dropdown menu, select **Upload files**.
5. **Drag and Drop or Select Files:** You can either drag and drop your files into the space provided or click **choose your files** to upload them from your computer.
6. **Commit Changes:** Once your files are uploaded, scroll down to the **Commit changes** section. 
   - Enter a brief description of the changes in the commit message field (e.g., "Adding new module materials").
   - Click **Commit changes** to finalize your upload.

## Overview of Manual Development
Each module manual should encompass the following essential components to ensure a comprehensive learning experience:

1. **Background of the Topic:** 
   - Provide a thorough explanation of key concepts related to the module.
   - Discuss the significance and relevance of the topic in the broader context of the field.
   - Include historical background or foundational theories where applicable.
   - Utilize visuals, such as diagrams or charts, to enhance understanding.

2. **Learning Outcomes:**
   - Clearly articulate the expected learning outcomes for the module.
   - Detail specific skills or knowledge participants should gain upon completion.
   - Consider framing outcomes in measurable terms to facilitate assessment (e.g., "By the end of this module, participants will be able to analyze genomic sequences using specific software tools.").
   - Include any prerequisites or foundational knowledge needed to achieve these outcomes.

3. **Detailed Steps or Exercises:**
   - Provide comprehensive, step-by-step instructions or exercises that participants should follow during the training.
   - Ensure each step is clearly numbered or bulleted for easy navigation.
   - Incorporate practical applications or case studies that relate to the theoretical content covered.
   - Include checkpoints or self-assessment questions at various stages to reinforce learning and allow participants to gauge their understanding.
   - Specify any required materials, tools, or software for each exercise, along with troubleshooting tips where necessary.
   - Encourage participants to document their findings and reflections to enhance the learning experience.

By including these components, the module manuals will facilitate a deeper understanding of the content and provide participants with the tools necessary for practical application.

## Laboratory Manual Content Examples
- **Step-by-Step Instructions or Exercises:** Participants are expected to follow specific protocols during the lab sessions to ensure consistency and accuracy in their work. Each laboratory session should clearly outline:
  - The objectives of the exercises.
  - Detailed methodologies, including equipment and materials needed.
  - Safety protocols to follow during the experiments.
  - Data collection and analysis methods.
  
  - Example Lab Manual: [AMR Africa 24](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11ZoiNcW36ZJ80YtqK269XRh3K4a577vS/view?usp=sharing)
